    <h1>What is MavsForChange?</h1>
    <p>
        MavsForChange is an action oriented organization that empowers students to make change at UNO. 
        MFC aims to make all students feel as though they can tackle the problems they face 
        and improve their educational experience at anytime throughout their time at UNO. 
        We believe that their should be no barriers for students, and we break down these barriers, through
        partnering with administration, providing resources, and allowing students to participate when it works for them.
