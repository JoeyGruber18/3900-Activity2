                    Hi! I am Joey Gruber, and I currently am in my third year at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
                    I am a double major in IT Innovation and Communcations, and I work alongside two other students to create
                    MavsForChange. This organization is for students by students, and we want to make change accessible to all students. 
                    We have a variety of resources, contacts, workshops, and more to get the ball rolling for anyone. Happy Change Making!
                </p>
